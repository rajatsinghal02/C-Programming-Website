           <b> C Introduction</b>
           <hr>
        </h1>
        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.</p>

           <p> It is a very popular language, despite being old.</p>
            
           <p>C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
           
           <hr>
           <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
           <hr>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

                </li>
            </ul>
        
          <h2>
            Difference between C and C++
          </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
            C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax
        </li>
    
       </ul>

<h1>Getting Started With C</h1>
<p>To start using C, you need two things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A text editor,like Notepad, to write C code
    </li>
    <li>
        A compiler,like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that computer can understand
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
</p>
<hr>
<h2>
    C Install IDE
</h2>
<p>
    An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.<br>
<br>
Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.<br>
<br>
<strong><b>Note:</b></strong> Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.<br>
<br>
We will use Online GDB Compiler in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.<br>
<br>
You can find Online GDB  at <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/"><strong>https://www.onlinegdb.com/ .</strong></a>
